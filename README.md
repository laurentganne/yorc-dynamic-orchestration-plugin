# Yorc Dynamic Orchestration plugin

The Yorc Dynamic Orchestration plugin implements a Yorc ([Ystia orchestrator](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/)) plugin as described in [Yorc documentation](https://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html), allowing the orchestrator
to dynamically change the location of infrastructure resources to create in a workflow.
